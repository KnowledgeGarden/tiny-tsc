T-Cell protein kinase activated by H2O2.  Protein kinase C phosphorylates IkB bound to p50-p65 Rel complex.   Degradation of bound IkB triggered, and p50-p65 Rel complex released.   Free p50-p65 Rel complex translocated to nucleus.   Translocated p50-p65 Rel complex binds to gene KB site and Proviral gene activated.   Proviral gene transcription initiated.
