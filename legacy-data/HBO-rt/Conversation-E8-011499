 Growth hormone binds to membrane receptor and tyrosine kinase activated.  Activated tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Shc.   Phosphorylated Shc induces activation of c-Ras.  Activated c-Ras induces c-Raf activation.  Activated c-Raf induces MAPK.kinase activation.  Activated MAPK.kinase induces MAPK activation.
