If so, it records that this site is occupied by bB for the first site found.  And vice versa for a bB binding site specific to A.FIRST.POLYMER.ELEMENT This slot is used within the container object of bunch of polymer elements, andpoints to the first element in the polymer chain.FIRST.SEGMENT The first segment in a DNA or RNA chain.FOLLOW.SLOT.POINTERS	????GENERALIZED.SEQUENCEGENERIC.COMPONENT.OBJECTS Lists the set of variables which name the components of this object.GENERIC.OBJECT.REFERENCE.P This type of relation can take as a value the name of an object class within the library.  Usually this relation describes some generic relation between objects  which is instantiated not at object-instantiation time, but at a later time within the simulator. For example, a gene might contain a pointer to the name of the polypeptide it codes for. The polypeptide would be instantiated by the translation process.GENERIC.PROTEASE  Cells contain proteases. I don't know much more about them...GET.VALUE X Y  The value of slot X of object Y. -- possibly (email) the value of slot Y in object XHAS.COMPONENT HAS.COMPONENT.RINACTIVATED.REPRESSORS These are repressors which have been inactivated by the binding of a cofactor (e.g. lactose).INVERSE A backward link, e.g., the inverse of PARENTS would be CHILDREN.IRBOUND Irreversibly boundIRREGULAR.POLYMERS  The subclass of polymers which don't consist of a regularly repeating single pattern, e.g. DNA.IS.PART X Y   Predicate. T if object X is component part of container object Y.  To satisfy, make component part of container.  To violate, delete component from container.IS.PART.R X Y   Predicate. T if object X is component part of container object Y or if X is part of any part of Y.KEY For a 2-place relation, this slot points to the relation which holds one of the places. For example, if a unit containeda slot neighboring-points and a slot distance-to-neighboring-points, the first would be the key for the second, since the distance slot indicates the distance between the current unit-point and the point named in the correspondingelement of the neighboring-points slot.LEAKY.TERMINATORS 	A leaky terminator gives rise to both transcription elongation and transcription termination.LIFETIME (INTEGER) mRNA is degraded and hence has a lifetime within the cellLONG.SYNONYMS A list of synonyms for the name ofthis unit.  These are full-names for this unit as opposed to abreviations.MEDIA  Description of a culture medium in which a bacterium can be grown.MEMB X Y  Predicate.  Atom X is an element of list Y.

To violate, delete atom from list.MISC.MRNA.SEGMENT  We'll map a number of different types of DNA segments to this mRNA segment.MOLECULAR.COMPLEXES Describes groups of molecules that are bound together.MRNA.SEGMENT.POSITION The ribosome's current position on a piece of mRNA it is transcribing.MUT.TRP-R.OPERATOR.BINDING.SITE  A mutant binding site which will not bind to the operatorMUT.TRP-R.TRP.BINDING.SITE This binding site contains a mutation which prevents it from binding to trp.MUTATION.PA-ISOMERASE  Prevents PA-Isomerase from doing its thingMUTATION.TRP-APOR.BINDS.OP This mutation prevents the trpR operator binding site from doing its thing.MUTATION.TRP-APOR.BINDS.TRP This mutation prevents the trp apo repressor trp binding site from binding to trp.MUTATIONS  A generic description of a mutation in some object.NEXT.POLYMER.ELEMENT This slot is used within the elements within a polymer and points to the neighboring element of the current element in the polymer.NUCLEIC.ACID.PROTEINS  Complexes of protein and RNA or DNANUMBER.OF.AA.RESIDUES (INTEGER)OBJECT.COPIED.TO	????OBJECT.EXISTS X Y  Predicate. Object X exists within class Y.  To satisfy, add object to class. To violate, delete object from class.OBJECT.INTERACTING.WITH.SITE The current object with which this slot is interacting, if any.OBJECT.REFERENCE.P TRUE if this relation contains a reference to another object in the same structural complex as this object.  Used both during object instantiation(in theory anyway; this hasn't been implemented yet), and during structure copying.  For example, if we're describing a binding site, it might have a property BOUND-TO, which would list the object this is bound to.  Thus SITE.A.1 might be bound to SITE.B.1.  If we made a copy of the structure, we might have to change the value to reflect that SITE.A.2 is bound to SITE.B.2.  I believe that whenever this slot is set, the Transfer.On.Object.Copy slot should beset also.OBJECT.REFERENCE.PROPERTIES  These slots contain other object names as their values, and hence should be patched during object forking to point to new objects in a substructure.OLIGO.PROTEINS  Proteins containing more than one polypeptide.OPERATORS  The Promoters.Controlled slot of all operators must indicate the name of a single class of promoters which this operator controls.  The fact that this slot is filled means that this operator is functioning sufficiently well to control the promoter so named.  If one operon contains several promoters, they must be within different classes so it can be specified that the operator only controls one of them.OUTPUT.FUNCTIONS  Lists the functions which allow us to compute the Output.Variables for this process.PA-ISOMERASE.MUT  A mutant Phosphoribosyl-Anthranilate-Isomerase with no catalytic activity.PARALLEL.RELATIONS Lists the one or more relations whose elements correspond to the elements of this relation.PARAMETER.OBJECT.CLASSES  This slot is a list in one-to-one correspondence with the slot Parameter.Objects, and lists the class from which each object may come.PARAMETER.OBJECTS  The objects that must exist for this process to become active.PART.RELATIONS The different ways that an object can be a part of another object.PHOSPHORIBOSYL-ANTHRANILATE-ISOMERASE This enzyme converts phosophoribosyl-anthranilate to CdRP to InGP (indoleglycerol phosphate synthetase) - it catalyzes two reactions.POLARITY	one.of	POLAR NON-POLARPOLYMER.LENGTH The number of primitives from which this polymer is formed.POLYMER.SEQUENCE The sequence of primitive elements of which this particular polymer is composed.POLYPEPTIDE.CODED.FOR The polypeptide which this gene encodes.POTENTIAL.INTERACTING.OBJECTS The type(s) of objects with which this active site can interact.PRECONDITIONS.A NIL Additional constraints inherited via UNION.PRECONDITIONS.M Logical constraints upon the activation of this process, as opposed to numeric constraints.PROCESS.FIRINGS A list of PACTs for processes this object has made fire.PROCESSES.DISABLED The one or more processes or classes of processes which a particular mutation disables.PROMOTERS.CONTROLLED Lists the promoters which this operator controls.  Inclusion in this list embodies virtually all the criteria by which it's determined that a promoter is controlled by an operator.PUT.VALUE X Y Z Store Z into slot X of object Y.QUANTIFIED.MUTATION.CONDITION   The old condition which checked all process parameters for mutations specific to the current process.QUANTITY.CONDITIONS.A  Additional preconditions inherited via UNIONQUANTITY.CONDITIONS.M Any object state checks which we have to perform to activate this process.RBOUND  Reversibly boundRECEPTIVE.TO.POLYMERASE Describes the state of this promoter: can polymerase bind to it or not?  This state is determined by the presence of nearby activator or repressor proteins.REDUNDANCY Number of different t-rnas corresponding to -- cardinality.max=6 cardinality.min=1REDUNDANCY Number of different t-rnas of this typeREGULAR.POLYMERS  The class of polymers resulting from the repeat of a single pattern, e.g. nylon.RELATION.TO.CONTAINERS Describes how this object is contained by the object of which it is a part.RELEASE.BINDING.SITES When A and B are no longer directly bound together, this code checks to see if A contains a site which is occupied by B.  If so it terminates this occupation.  And vice-versa for a site within B occupied by A.REPCOF.COMPLEXES Repressor/Cofactor complexesREPOP.COMPLEXES  Repressor/Operator complexesREPRESSORS  These repressors are in such a state that they can bind to an operator, either because they're bound to an activating cofactor or because this is their natural state.REVERSIBLE.PROCESSRIBOSOME.BINDING.SITE RIBOSOME.RBS.BINDING.SITE  The site on the ribosome which binds to the ribosome binding site.RNA-ANALOGUE The base which substitutes for this one in an RNA strand.RNA-COMPLEMENT The base which complements this one in double-stranded RNA.RNA.GENE 	A transcribed gene sitting on an mRNA transcirpt.RNA.SEGMENT.PRODUCED	For a DNA segment, lists the class of RNA segment that transcription of the DNA segment produces.

They are used to established relations between components of the object. <<INHERITANCE BY INSTANCES>>STRUCTURE.COPY.CORRESPONDENCES If this object was the root object created by a COPY.STRUCTURE or COPY.SUBSTRUCTURE operation, this slot will contain a list of correspondences between old and new objects in the two structure.STRUCTURE.COPY.SOURCE.OBJECT The object to which a COPY.STRUCTURE operationwas applied to create this object.TECHNIQUES   A description of experimental techniquesTIME.SCALE The approximate time scale of this process, e.g., is it instantaneous or does it take years to complete?TRANSCRIBED.OPERON The operon which was transcribed to produce this piece of mRNA.TRANSFER.ON.OBJECT.COPY  If TRUE, this slot means that the value of the named property should be transferred (copied) from the old to the new object during an Object-Copy operation.Referenced by COPY.OBJECT.  If in addition the property should be patched after the copy because it contains an object reference, then the Object.Reference.P slot property for the slot should be set as well.TRANSLATED.DNA.SEGMENTS A list of those DNA segments that were translated to produce this polypeptide.  Normally this will be a single gene.  This might not be the case if for example a stop codon is removed.")TRP-APOREPRESSOR.NOB  This trpR does not bind to the operator.TRP-APOREPRESSOR.NTB  A mutant form of the Trp-ApoRepressor which does not bind trp.TRP-C.LC1419 See  trp.delta.LC1419TRP-D.ED102 See Trp.Operon.ED102TRP-D.ED24 See  trp.delta.ED24TRP-D.LD1412 See  trp.delta.LD1412TRP-E.ED24 See  trp.delta.ED24TRP-SYNTHETASE  This enzyme converts InGP (indoleglycerol phosphate) to tryptophan.TRP.DELTA.ED24  A trp operon deletion mutant in which most of trpE and trpD are missing.
