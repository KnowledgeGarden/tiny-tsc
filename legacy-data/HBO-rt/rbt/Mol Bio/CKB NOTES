NOTES from versions of PETER KARP'S CKBEntities which are VIEW.OF some other entity need a PROTOHISTORY.  If it is NIL, then discovery is needed.Ask: how to get to be a view of other entity?Same as Ice gets to be a view of Water by process of Freezing.Compiler for VIEW.OF can make Task to check that concept's PROTOHISTORY slot: if nil, make new task to fillin.If cannot fillin, regenerate task with slightly lower priority so it will later repeat.Notice SMALL.MOLECULES is Super, and is a VIEW.OF CHEMICALS which is also Super.  Protohistorywould be the way chemicals combine to form small molecules.CHEMICALS has some slots which are templates for all Subs and Views at compile time.  This calls for the ability touse them as templates.  Probably means COPY.CON copies all slots of the Super of the new concept, then sets up a taskto fill in values.NUCLEIC.ACID.SEGMENTS gets to be a view of CHEMICALS by means of a chemical reactionBy making BACTERIA a VIEW.OF ENTITIES.WITH.DISSOLVED.COMPONENTS, the required Protohistory suggestssomething about how "chemicals" combined as entites.with.dissolved.components" can become living things--an interestingtask for discovery!By making ACTIVATORS a VIEW.OF PROTEINS, we get to ask "how do proteins become activators?"PROTEASES seems to have only one neighbor GENERIC.PROTEASES which is used for holding definitional data.  Are there anyother kinds of proteases?  If not, there may be no need for one or the other.New concepts:	blood feathers plasma hair milk egg.white saliva heat All slots are defined at BASIC level.The Karp slot:	STRUCTURAL.RELATIONS	(FORALL *COMPONENT (AND (MEMB *COMPONENT									(XGET.VALUES OBJECT (QUOTE COMPONENT.OBJECTS)))) 								((XADD.PAIRED.VALUE *COMPONENT 									(QUOTE RELATION.TO.CONTAINERS) OBJECT (QUOTE RBOUND))))))seems to mean: for all values bound to *COMPONENT which are also members of OBJECT COMPONENT.OBJECTS,	add the slot-value pair RELATION.TO.CONTAINERS RBOUND.OPEN QUESTIONS:  how does *COMPONENT get bound? What is OBJECT?SET.VALUE compiler ( list handler ) must deal with reals -- ( set.value ( x y 1.0e-5 ) )How it works:given:				c:	TRP.OPERON					level	sub					sub.of	OPERONS					COMPONENT.OBJECT.CLASSES	TRP.PROMOTER TRP.OPERATOR TRP.LEADER 													DRIBOSOME.BINDING.SITE TRP-E DSTOP.CODON 													DRIBOSOME.BINDING.SITE TRP-D DSTOP.CODON 													DRIBOSOME.BINDING.SITE TRP-C DSTOP.CODON 													DRIBOSOME.BINDING.SITE TRP-B DSTOP.CODON													DRIBOSOME.BINDING.SITE TRP-A DSTOP.CODON 													TRP.TERMINATOR					GENERIC.COMPONENT.OBJECTS	*PRO *OP *LEADER *DRBS1 *TRPE *DSC1 *DRBS2 													*TRPD *DSC2 *DRBS3 *TRPC *DSC3 *DRBS4 *TRPB 													*DSC4 *DRBS5 *TRPA *DSC5 *TERM					*inherit>		FIRST.SEGMENT *PRO					*inherit>>		*OP PROMOTERS.CONTROLLED *PRO					*inherit>>		*PRO 3PRIME.SEGMENT *OP 					*inherit>>		*OP 3PRIME.SEGMENT *LEADER					*inherit>>		*LEADER 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DRBS1 					*inherit>>		*DRBS1 3PRIME.SEGMENT *TRPE					*inherit>>		*TRPE 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DSC1					*inherit>>		*DSC1 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DRBS2 					*inherit>>		*DRBS2 3PRIME.SEGMENT *TRPD 					*inherit>>		*TRPD 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DSC2 					*inherit>>		*DSC2 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DRBS3					*inherit>>		*DRBS3 3PRIME.SEGMENT *TRPC 					*inherit>>		*TRPC 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DSC3 					*inherit>>		*DSC3 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DRBS4 					*inherit>>		*DRBS4 3PRIME.SEGMENT *TRPB 					*inherit>>		*TRPB 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DSC4					*inherit>>		*DSC4 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DRBS5 					*inherit>>		*DRBS5 3PRIME.SEGMENT *TRPA 					*inherit>>		*TRPA 3PRIME.SEGMENT *DSC5 					*inherit>>		*DSC5  3PRIME.SEGMENT *TERMA user sends a CREATE.INSTANCE message to TRP.OPERON which gets instantiated with a unique name -- TRP.OPERON.01, say.Same message sent to each unit in COMPONENT.OBJECT.CLASSES slot of TRP.OPERON.  Names of each are recorded inCOMPONENT.OBJECTS slot of TRP.OPERON ( a template-inherited slot) and are bound to the GENERIC.COMPONENT.OBJECTSunits.Then, run STRUCTURAL.RELATIONS from object class on the bindings.  For example, TRP.OPERON <s OPERON <s DNA.SEGMENTS<s NUCLEIC.ACID.SEGMENTS <v ( entities.with.irbound.components chemicals ), where entities.with.irbound.components has structural.relations slot.{this implies CREATE.INSTANCE must inherit along views}.
