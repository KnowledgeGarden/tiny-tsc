Change notes=============================BIG NOTE:  ISA? doesn't work on synonyms which aren't defined		the synonym slot must have its compile-time behavior designed to copy over		the sub.of or instance.of slot to the synonym		Most other taxonomy search thingies need to consider synonyms=============================More.Crystal.Stuff.T changed to Crystal-1Crystals.KB.1.T changed to Crystal-2.TSlots.T not used -- consider deleting.Created Formation.Models.T and removed them from Solid.T	The idea here is to begin the process of building a KB of process rules related to	all processes involved in all kinds of materials.  This file should, contain the	anchors for a bunch of other files e.g. Chalcopyrite.Formation.KB,	Pharmaceutical.Formation.KB, etc.Created Formation.Processes.T	To serve as the anchors for all kinds of physical process rules involved in 	formation models.  The taxonomy there is based on the index from a	Chemical Metallurgy book.  The taxonomy needs lively debate.Created Systems.T	To serve as the anchors for all kinds of systems in which materials participateKilled *Loader, updated *Loader.agjChopped up pyroelectrics into Pyroelectrics.T and Pyroelectrics.DBChopped up ionic.compounds.db into Ionic.Compounds.T and Ionic.Compounds.DBRenamed spgrps.subof.db SpGrps.TEdited 3d.sub/super.pointgroups  -- this should be a .T file	when I set something, e.g. TWO as a sub of, say, SIX/MMM, I deleted the fact	that SIX was a sub.of super.group because it is a sub of something which already is.Renamed spaceGroupFile.reduced SpGroup.reduced.DBRenamed definitions.1.db Definitions.T	this file really ought to be split out to the various systems	Added "information.slot" to many classes, HAVE LOTS OF &&&& in this file	removed several classes already elsewhere	Definitions.T now just defines things that are not defined elsewhereExtensions.TSC has been updated -- LOTS OF &&&& to see there	Added electronegative.element and electropositive.element and predicates	which check any element to see it is one or the other -- definition slot added	\	¥  means I have checked a concept name for duplicates.  Some are hard to	check because they get hundreds of hits.======================In the interest of making this project a "model" TSC project, I have gone throughsome files, e.g. chalcopyrites.5.db and reformatted frames to the model format:c:	<name>	taxonomic slot	structural or similar slot	data slotse.g.+c:	Cu2GeSe3			lattice.parameter.a	5.589	lattice.parameter.b	5.589	lattice.parameter.c	10.970		c.to.a.ratio	1.9628		has.parts	Cu	Ge	Se		sub.of	Ib.IIIa.VIa.compoundwas changed to+c:	Cu2GeSe3			sub.of	Ib.IIIa.VIa.compound	has.parts	Cu	Ge	Se		lattice.parameter.a	5.589	lattice.parameter.b	5.589	lattice.parameter.c	10.970		c.to.a.ratio	1.9628	===============================================The file chalcopyrites.5.db has some &&&& to look atUpdated Materials.T by adding solutionCreated Science.T to hold a variety of general science stuff	will probably pull all that stuff already in TSC out to put in this file.Added a question to ajatom.elements.2a.db under hydrogen	question deals with the taxonomy--database interface regarding elements	Open issue is that we will want to hold a couple of elements up in the air and	ask what kind of bond can occur between them, so the elements.db needs to support	such inferencing.  SEE BOND.TYPE in Materials.T for an example of support code	envisioned for materials KBs.Created Periodic.Table.T and moved a bunch of stuff out of the AJ. DBs.
