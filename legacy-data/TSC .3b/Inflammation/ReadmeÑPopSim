		Modification Of The Immune Knowledge Base For Use With PopSimFile:	BIO.PRIMITIVE.TNo modifications for PopSim.File:	CELL.TNo modifications for PopSim.File:	Immune.TSee "CHANGES" comments in Immune.T.File:	Immune.RBTSee  "CHANGES" comments in Immune.RBT, and comments related to use of "excretes" and "secretes" in association with the rules VIRAL.ANTIGEN.PRODUCTION and ANTIGEN.PROCESSING.M.File:	IMMUNE.EXPFor PopSim the experiment frame, Immune.E1.Exp, is separate from the initial conditions frame, Immune.E1.  The PopSim translator expects the experiment frame to contain an "initial.conditions" slot which points to the initial conditions frame. PopSim also requires a slightly different task frame than that used for building a QP envisionment.See the comments in IMMUNE.EXP.		General Instructions for Starting a PopSim Simulation1.	Launch PopSim Server and TSC2.	Using TSC Include command:	A.	Include *PopSim.Translator.Loader	B.	Include *BIO.Loader3.	Engage TSC4.	After the number of iterations requested in the experiment frame, PopSim will pause and TSC will switch from collecting PopSim results to expanding a QP envisionment.  You may go into the PopSim file menu and use the "Resume Simulation" command to continue iterating.  No more results will be sent to TSC.  The full history of populations can be saved in a text file using the PopSim "Save Data" command.
