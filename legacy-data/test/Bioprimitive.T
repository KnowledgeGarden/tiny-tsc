( *x *y ) true )	we probably need PART.OF? which searches up part.of to answer ( part.of? ( *x *y ) true )	but that has the problem: ( part.of? ( organ population ) true ) is true in the sense that organs make up individual organisms, which, in turn, make up populations.  So, PART.OF? may need to consider what "sense" is being tested.}{ NOTE:	TSC now REQUIRES that everything be linked somewhere in the taxonomy ultimately to THING, STUFF, IDEA, RECIPE}\ we could go above biosphere, all the way to astronomical domains\ c:	biosphere	sub.of	thing c:	ecosystem	part.of	biosphere	sub.of	thing c:	population	part.of	ecosystem	sub.of	thing c:	organism	part.of	population	sub.of	thing c:	organ	part.of	organism	sub.of	thing c:	tissue	part.of	organ	sub.of	stuff +c:	cell	level		basic	my.creator	rbt jp2	part.of		tissue	sub.of		thing\ wow! cell, sub.of thing is part.of tissue, sub.of stuff... c:	homo.sapien	level		basic	my.creator	jp2 rbt	sub.of	organism c:	human	level		basic	my.creator	jp2 rbt	sub.of	organism\ what relation connects this to species?\ c:	human.being	level		basic	my.creator	rbt	sub.of	organism	synonym		human homo.sapien c:	cell.compartment	part.of	cell	sub.of	thing c:	organelle	part.of	cell.compartment	sub.of	thing c:	compound			\ watch this	part.of	organelle	sub.of	stuff{  c:	atom				\ watch this for collisions with biochem kb	part.of	compound	sub.of	thing}\  ____________________________________________________________ family tree\ rbt changes in taxonomic terms e.g, phyla>phylum, genera>genus, etc  100192 c:	kingdom	sub.of	thing	\ ???? c:	phylum	sub.of	kingdom c:	class	sub.of	phylum c:	order	sub.of	class c:	family	sub.of	order c:	genus	sub.of	family c:	species	sub.of	genus\ _____________________________________________________________LIFE FORMS\ rbt   various life forms added consistent with accepted taxonomic conventions  100192 c:	viroid	my.creator	rbt	sub.of		thing	\ where do these go in family tree???? c:	virus	my.creator	rbt	sub.of		thing c:	bacterium	my.creator	rbt	sub.of		thing	 c:	fungus	my.creator	rbt	sub.of		thing c:	plant	my.creator	rbt	sub.of		thing	 c:	animal	my.creator	rbt	sub.of		thing
