NewCentury 12point, TabStops=4, LineWrap=100.3/12/92			jp2: began adding taxonomy stuff from Matrix document10/01/92		changes in taxonomic terms e.g, phyla>phylum, genera>genus, etc10/01/92		rbt: various life forms added consistent with accepted taxonomic conventions2/24/93			jp2: update to new TSC syntax2/13/94			rbt:  commented out organelle--it appears in cell.T, and seems to have little function here				compound had a pretty useless partOf  organelle declaration.  compound seems lie it				should be lower in the hierarchy--in physics or chemistry part of B 				font is currently Chicago.2/26/94			Major changes in organization; varius pathogens and life forms added6/28/94			compound def. changed:  Now no relation to organelle6/30/94			biological.process/bio.process added as subOf phys.process [ in TSC root ]6/14/96			glycoprotein, glyconjugate moved from Histo.t6/30/96			Regulatory subtances, etc, moved from Histo.t; elements, ions, enzymes added8/15/97			Hormone.bond and peptide Hormone.bond moved to cell-Histo.t7/6/98			plant stuff added for allergy KB support20050207 updated}\ ____________________________________________________________ BIG STUFF{ NOTE:	we have ISA? which searches up subs, instances to answer ( isa? ( *x *y ) true )	we probably need partOf? which searches up partOf to answer ( partOf? ( *x *y ) true )	but that has the problem: ( partOf? ( organ population ) true ) is true in the sense that organs make up individual organisms, which, in turn, make up populations.  So, partOf? may need to consider what "sense" is being tested.}{ NOTE:	TSC now REQUIRES that everything be linked somewhere in the taxonomy ultimately to THING, STUFF, IDEA, RECIPE}\ we could go above biosphere, all the way to astronomical domains\c:	biosphere	subOf		thing	c:	organism	subOf		thing	c:	multicellular.organism	subOf		organism		c:	ecosystem	partOf		biosphere	subOf		thingc:	population	partOf		ecosystem	subOf		thingc:	biological.process	subOf		phys.process	myCreator	rbtc:	bio.process	subOf		phys.process	synonym		biological.process	myCreator	rbtc:	organ	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	circulatory.system	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	digestive.system	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thing	c:	respiratory.system	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	nervous.system	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	tissue	partOf		organ	subOf		stuffc:	cell.aggregation	subOf		thing	myCreator	rbt	c:	gland	subOf		cell.aggregation	myCreator	rbtc:	cell	level		basic	myCreator	rbt jp2	partOf		tissue organ cell.aggregation	subOf		thingc:	biological.cell	level		basic	subOf		cell	myCreator	rbtc:	bio.cell	level		basic	subOf		cell	synonym		biological.cell		myCreator	jp2	c:	eukaryotic.cell	subOf		bio.cell	    \ view or sub?
