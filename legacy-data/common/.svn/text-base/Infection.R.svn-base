\ ___________________________________________________INFECTIOUS AGENT PROCESSEScomment:	this rule has a problem with the "no false actors" syntax rule:		without antigen as actor, you cannot use the "excretes" relation here to limit firing	that is: we need some sort of unary relation for virus which will get changed on firing	I choose--for purposes of trials--"excited"	note that this has been added to initial conditions as well	second cut: i choose ifNotActors, and deleted "excited" from IC	No special semantics are associated with "excretes" for PopSim translation.  The default	translation for the relation "excretes (*virus *antigen)" is to create a feature named	"excretes.antigen".  A "thenRelates" message will assign this feature to the virus actor.	An "ifRelates" message will test for previous assignment of the feature. 	The actual production of a new antigen actor is accomplished by the combination of 	"thenCreate ( *antigen )" and "thenActors ( ( antigen ( *antigen ) true ) )".comment;c:	VIRAL.antigen.PRODUCTION	level		basic	subOf		phys.process	instanceOf	process.rule \  	myCreator	rbt	context		immunology	ifActors		( ( virus ( *virus ) true ) 	                  ( antigen ( *antigen ) true ) ) 	thenActors	( ( antigen ( *antigen ) true ) )	thenRelates	( ( excretes ( *virus *antigen ) true ) )	thenSay		" virus excretes antigen.
