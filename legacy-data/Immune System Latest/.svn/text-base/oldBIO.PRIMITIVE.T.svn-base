( *x *y ) true )	we probably need PART.OF? which searches up part.of to answer ( part.of? ( *x *y ) true )	but that has the problem: ( part.of? ( organ population ) true ) is true in the sense that organs make up individual organisms, which, in turn, make up populations.  So, PART.OF? may need to consider what "sense" is being tested.}{ NOTE:	TSC now REQUIRES that everything be linked somewhere in the taxonomy ultimately to THING, STUFF, IDEA, RECIPE}\ we could go above biosphere, all the way to astronomical domains\ c:	BIOSPHERE	sub.of	thing c:	ECOSYSTEM	part.of	biosphere	sub.of	thing c:	POPULATION	part.of	ecosystem	sub.of	thing c:	ORGANISM	part.of	population	sub.of	thing c:	ORGAN	part.of	organism	sub.of	thing c:	TISSUE	part.of	organ	sub.of	stuff +c:	CELL	level		basic	my.creator	rbt jp2	part.of		tissue	sub.of		thing\ WOW!
