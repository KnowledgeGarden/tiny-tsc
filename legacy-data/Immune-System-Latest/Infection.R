\ ___________________________________________________INFECTIOUS AGENT PROCESSEScomment:	this rule has a problem with the "no false actors" syntax rule:		without antigen as actor, you cannot use the "excretes" relation here to limit firing	that is: we need some sort of unary relation for virus which will get changed on firing	I choose--for purposes of trials--"excited"	note that this has been added to initial conditions as well	second cut: i choose if.not.actors, and deleted "excited" from IC	No special semantics are associated with "excretes" for PopSim translation.  The default	translation for the relation "excretes (*virus *antigen)" is to create a feature named	"excretes.antigen".  A "then.relates" message will assign this feature to the virus actor.	An "if.relates" message will test for previous assignment of the feature. 	The actual production of a new antigen actor is accomplished by the combination of 	"then.create ( *antigen )" and "then.actors ( ( antigen ( *antigen ) true ) )".comment;c:	VIRAL.ANTIGEN.PRODUCTION	level		basic	sub.of		phys.process	instance.of	process.rule \ popsim.rule	my.creator	rbt	context		immunology	if.actors		( ( virus ( *virus ) true ) 	                  ( antigen ( *antigen ) true ) ) 	then.actors	( ( antigen ( *antigen ) true ) )	then.relates	( ( excretes ( *virus *antigen ) true ) )	then.say		" Virus excretes antigen.
