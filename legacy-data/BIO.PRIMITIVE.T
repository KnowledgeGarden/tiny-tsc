NewCentury 12point, TabStops=4, LineWrap=100.3/12/92			jp2: began adding taxonomy stuff from Matrix document10/01/92			changes in taxonomic terms e.g, phyla>phylum, genera>genus, etc10/01/92			rbt: various life forms added consistent with accepted taxonomic conventions2/24/93			jp2: update to new TSC syntax2/13/94			rbt:  commented out organelle--it appears in CELL.T, and seems to have little function here				compound had a pretty useless partOf  organelle declaration.  Compound seems lie it				should be lower in the hierarchy--in physics or chemistry part of B 				font is currently Chicago.2/26/94			Major changes in organization; varius pathogens and life forms added6/28/94			Compound def. changed:  Now no relation to organelle6/30/94			Biological.process/bio.process added as subOf phys.process [ in TSC root ]}\ ____________________________________________________________ BIG STUFF{ NOTE:	we have ISA? which searches up subs, instances to answer ( isa? ( *x *y ) true )	we probably need partOf? which searches up partOf to answer ( partOf? ( *x *y ) true )	but that has the problem: ( partOf? ( organ population ) true ) is true in the sense that organs make up individual organisms, which, in turn, make up populations.  So, partOf? may need to consider what "sense" is being tested.}{ NOTE:	TSC now REQUIRES that everything be linked somewhere in the taxonomy ultimately to THING, STUFF, IDEA, RECIPE}\ we could go above biosphere, all the way to astronomical domains\c:	BIOSPHERE	subOf		thing	c:	ORGANISM	subOf		thing	c:	MULTICELLULAR.ORGANISM	subOf		organism		c:	ECOSYSTEM	partOf		biosphere	subOf		thingc:	POPULATION	partOf		ecosystem	subOf		thingc:	BIOLOGICAL.PROCESS	subOf		phys.process	myCreator	rbtc:	BIO.PROCESS	subOf		phys.process	synonym		biological.process	myCreator	rbtc:	ORGAN	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	Circulatory.system	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	Nervous.system	partOf		multicellular.organism	subOf		thingc:	TISSUE	partOf		organ	subOf		stuffc:	Cell.aggregation	subOf		thing	myCreator	rbt	c:	Gland	subOf		Cell.aggregation	myCreator	rbtc:	CELL	level		basic	myCreator	rbt jp2	partOf		tissue organ cell.aggregation	subOf		thingc:	CELL.COMPARTMENT	partOf		cell	subOf		thing{c:	ORGANELLE				\	rbt: removed for better position/definition in CELL.T	partOf		cell.compartment	subOf		thing}c:	COMPOUND			subOf		stuff	c:	ATOM					\ watch this for collisions with biochem kb	partOf		compound	\ partOf molecule too	subOf		thingc:	Peptide	subOf		compoundc:	Polypeptide	synonym		peptide	myCreator	rbt		c:	PROTEIN	subOf		peptide	c:	MOLECULE	subOf		thing	c:	LIPID	subOf		compound		c:	CARBOHYDRATE			subOf		compound	c:	SUGAR			subOf		carbohydrate	\ ______________________________________________ FAMILY TREE\ rbt changes in taxonomic terms e.g, phyla>phylum, genera>genus, etc  100192	c:	ANIMAL	myCreator	rbt	subOf		organism	c:	PLANT	myCreator	rbt	subOf		organismc:	KINGDOM	subOf		thing	\ ????c:	PHYLUM	subOf		kingdomc:	CLASS	subOf		phylumc:	ORDER	subOf		classc:	FAMILY	subOf		orderc:	GENUS	subOf		familyc:	SPECIES	subOf		genus\ _____________________________________________________________LIFE FORMS\ rbt   various life forms added consistent with accepted taxonomic conventions  100192c:	VIROID	myCreator	rbt	subOf		organism \ where do these go in family tree????c:	VIRUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		organismc:	BACTERIUM	myCreator	rbt	subOf		organism	c:	FUNGUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		organism	c:	VERTEBRATE	myCreator	rbt	subOf		multicellular.organismc:	MAMMAL	myCreator	rbt	subOf		vertebrate	c:	RODENT	myCreator	rbt	subOf		MAMMALc:	PRIMATE	myCreator	rbt	subOf		mammal\  FAMILY AND GENERA OF LIFE FORMS    rbt:  2/94c:	BACTERIOPHAGE	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		phagec:	HERPESVIRUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		herpes.virus	c:	HUMAN.IMMUNODEFICIENCY.VIRUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		HIVc:	HIV	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		HUMAN.IMMUNODEFICIENCY.VIRUS	c:	HUMAN.T-LYMPHOTROPIC.VIRUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		HTLV	c:	HTLV	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		HUMAN.T-LYMPHOTROPIC.VIRUS	c:	INFLUENZA.VIRUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		influenzac:	INFLUENZA	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		influenza.virus	c:	RHINOVIRUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		virus	synonym		cold.virus	c:	COCCUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		bacterium	c:	BACILLUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		bacterium	synonym		rod		c:	PNEUMOCOCCUS	myCreator	rbt	subOf		coccusc:	RAT	myCreator	rbt	subOf		rodentc:	HOMO.SAPIEN	level		basic	myCreator	jp2 rbt	subOf		primatec:	HUMAN	level		basic	myCreator	jp2 rbt	subOf		primate\ what relation connects this to SPECIES?\c:	HUMAN.BEING	level		basic	myCreator	rbt	subOf		primate	synonym		human homo.sapien
